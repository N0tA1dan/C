# C

Here is everything you need to know on getting started with C.

# Introduction

C is a procedural programming language which is used for bulding systems, implementing algorithms, game development, and mostly anything you can imagine.

# Upsides

- C is very fast and can be used for virtually anything. 
- C has a very clean syntax and is implemented in many applications we use today
- C is Powerful and efficient



# Downsides

- C can be difficult to build high level applications without enough experience.
- C Lacks of memory safety 
- C Lacks of Object Orientation
- C has no namespace
- C has no Garbage Collection
- C has lack of DSA (Data structures & algorithms) or generics

And many more. Do not let the downsides scare you away from C, it takes skill to write and C and if you put the time in you can be a great programmer

# Language basics

### simple hello world program in C
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main(){
        printf("Hello World");
    }
    ```

    printf() is a function that outputs a formatted string to standard output(aka your display)
